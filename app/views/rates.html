<section>
  <h2>Project Management</h2>
  <p>The rates slowly increase over time, since the value of our service should increase with time.</p>
  <p>If the service provided isn't generating visible and demonstrable increasing value, then we've reached a plateau
  and running the project can be taken over by senior developers or internal management.</p>
